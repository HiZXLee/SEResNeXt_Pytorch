# SeResNeXT_Pytorch
SeResNeXt from scratch in Pytorch

Objective: To understand the architecture of SeResNeXt.

SEResNeXt utilizes [Squeeze and Excitation Block](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01507v4) as the bottleneck of [ResNeXt](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431v2).

seresnext50_32x4d was implemented, but the general structure is similar for other version.
